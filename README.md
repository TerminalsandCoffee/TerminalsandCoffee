**Cloud Security Engineer | Building Security Tools & AI Defense Systems via Recursive Self Improving Loops**

I build security tools that solve real problems — from LLM security proxies to network intrusion detection to shadow AI discovery. Creator of [Terminals and Coffee](https://madebyraf.tech), where I ship cybersecurity guides and courses on Gumroad.

## What I'm Building

| Project | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| [LLM Security Gateway](https://github.com/TerminalsandCoffee/llm-security-gateway) | Security proxy for LLM APIs — injection detection, PII scanning, SSE streaming, multi-provider (OpenAI + Bedrock), Terraform + CI/CD |
| [Shadow AI Hunter](https://github.com/TerminalsandCoffee/shadow-ai-hunter) | Go CLI that detects unauthorized AI service usage across proxy/DNS/firewall logs — 45+ AI services, 130+ domains |
| [Detection Engineering Lab](https://github.com/TerminalsandCoffee/detection-engineering-lab) | Wazuh-based detection rules with CI/CD pipeline and documentation |

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, Go, Bash, PowerShell, HCL

**Cloud & Infra:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, Bedrock, DynamoDB, CloudWatch), Terraform, GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Security:** Prompt injection detection, PII scanning, SIEM/detection engineering, network traffic analysis

**Frameworks:** FastAPI, httpx, boto3, Scapy
